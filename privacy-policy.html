            <p><strong>We do not collect any information.</strong></p>
            <p>Votery is designed to operate entirely offline on your device. The app does not connect to the internet and does not transmit any data to our servers or any third-party services.</p>

            <h3>Information Stored on Your Device</h3>
            <p>The following information is stored <strong>only on your device</strong> and never leaves it:</p>

            <h3>How Information is Used</h3>

            <h3>App Permissions</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Data is protected by your device's security features (screen lock, encryption)</li>
