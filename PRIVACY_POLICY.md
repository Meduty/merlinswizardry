## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any information.** 

Votery is designed to operate entirely offline on your device. The app does not connect to the internet and does not transmit any data to our servers or any third-party services.

## Information Stored on Your Device

The following information is stored **only on your device** and never leaves it:

- **Player Names:** Names you enter for players during gameplay
- **Option Labels:** Text labels you create for voting options
- **Game History:** Records of past games (winners, scores, dates)
- **Statistics:** Aggregated game statistics (total games played, favorite mode, etc.)
- **Settings:** Your app preferences (animation speed, game rules, etc.)

All this data is stored locally in your device's private storage space and is only accessible by the Votery app.

## How Information is Used

The locally stored information is used to:

- Display player names and options during gameplay
- Show you your game history and statistics
- Provide suggestions based on previously used names and options
- Remember your app settings and preferences
- Improve your user experience

**All processing happens on your device.** No data is ever sent to external servers.

## Information Sharing

**We do not share any information** because we don't collect any information. Everything stays on your device.

- No data is transmitted to our servers
- No data is shared with third parties

## Children's Privacy

Votery does not collect any information from children or adults. The app is suitable for all ages and does not require any personal information to use.

We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 (or applicable age in your jurisdiction). If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, please note that all data is stored locally on your device and can be deleted by clearing the app's data or uninstalling the app.

## App Permissions

**Internet Permission:** The app requests INTERNET permission only in development builds for Flutter development tools. **Production/release builds do not use any internet permissions.**

**No other permissions** are requested or required.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Data is protected by your device's security features (screen lock, encryption)
- Data is stored in the app's private storage area, inaccessible to other apps
- Data remains on your device and is never transmitted over networks
- Only you have access to the data (through the app or device file system)

## Data Retention and Deletion

You have complete control over your data:

- **Automatic Cleanup:** Player and option suggestions are automatically cleaned up after 6 months of inactivity
- **Game History:** Limited to the 100 most recent game sessions
- **Manual Deletion:** You can delete individual players and options through the app
- **Settings Reset:** You can reset all settings to defaults in the Settings page
- **Complete Deletion:** Uninstalling the app or clearing app data through Android settings will permanently delete all data

## Your Rights

- **Access:** View all data through the app interface
- **Modify:** Edit or update any stored information
- **Delete:** Remove data through app features or by uninstalling
- **Export:** No current export feature (data stays local)

## Android Backups

If you have enabled Android device backups (Google Drive backups), your app data may be included in those backups. These backups are controlled by Android and Google's privacy policies, not Votery. If you have privacy concerns, you can:

- Disable app backups in Android settings
- Exclude Votery from backups
- Clear app data before creating backups

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. Your continued use of the app after changes indicates acceptance of the updated policy.

We will notify users of material changes through app updates or the app store listing.

**Data Collection:** Optional user-provided names and game interaction data
